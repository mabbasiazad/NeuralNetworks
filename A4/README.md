## Autoencoders and RNNs

- Deep `Autoencoder` Neural Network (trained and tested on `MNIST` dataset)
- Implementing Backprop Through Time (`BPTT`) (a learning algorithm for recurrent neural networks (`RNN`s)).
- Training and Testing of RNN Class on sequence of letters in a text (a simplified version of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin).
