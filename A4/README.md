## Autoencoders and RNNs

- `Autoencoder` Neural Network
- Implementing Backprop Through Time (`BPTT`)
- Making Use of RNN to Generate Likely Sequence of English Sentences
      - Application: Training and testing of `RNN` class on sequence of letters in a text (a simplified version of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin)
