## Investigating Backprop, and HopÔ¨Åeld Networks]

- Investigating backprop
  - Implementing `Weight Decay` (backprop modification to tackle vanishing gradient problem)
  - `Classifier` Networks
  
- `Hopfield` Network (a model for associative memory)

Note: The problem description is in [a3_questions.pdf](./a3_questions.pdf) and the code is in [YOU_a3.ipynb](./YOU_a3.ipynb).
