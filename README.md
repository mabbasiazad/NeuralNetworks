   - A deep autoconcoder neural network is trained ans tested on MNIST dataset.
   - Backprop Through Time (BPTT) is implemented for a simple recurrent neural network (RNN).
     Then, an instance of the RNN class is trained and tested on sequence of letters in a corpus of text (a simplified version of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin).
