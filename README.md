# NeuralNetworks
1. [Modeling Spiking Neurons and Networks](./A1)
   - `LIF` Neuron Model
   - `Spiking` Network Model
   - Experiments with Spiking Networks

2. [Implementing Backpropagation](./A2)
   - Implementing `Backpropagation` (an algorithm for training feedforward neural networks in supervised learning)

3. [Investigating Backprop, and HopÔ¨Åeld Networks](./A3)
   - Investigating backprop
      - Implementing `Weight Decay` (backprop modification to tackle vanishing gradient problem)
      - `Classifier` Networks
   - `Hopfield` Network (a model of associative memory)

4. [Autoencoders and RNNs](./A4)
   - A deep `autoencoder` neural network is trained and tested on `MNIST` dataset.
   - Backprop Through Time (`BPTT`) learning algorithm is implemented for a simple recurrent neural network (`RNN`).
     Then, an instance of the RNN class is trained and tested on sequence of letters in a corpus of text (a simplified version of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin).
