# NeuralNetworks
1. [Modeling Spiking Neurons and Networks](./A1)
   - `LIF` Neuron Model
   - `Spiking` Network Nodel
   - Experiments with Spiking Networks

2. [Implementing Backpropagation](./A2)
   - backpropagation algorithm for training feedforward neural networks for supervised learning is coded from scratch.

3. [Investigating Backprop, and HopÔ¨Åeld Networks](./A3)
   - Backprop is modified to tackle `vanishing gradient` problem by implementing `weight decay`.
   - Backprop is investigated for `classifier` networks.
   - `Hopfield` Network as a model of associative memory is implemented.

4. [Autoencoders and RNNs](./A4)
   - A deep `autoencoder` neural network is trained and tested on `MNIST` dataset.
   - Backprop Through Time (`BPTT`) learning algorithm is implemented for a simple recurrent neural network (`RNN`).
     Then, an instance of the RNN class is trained and tested on sequence of letters in a corpus of text (a simplified version of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin).
